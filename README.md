# Access Point Direction Detection

Linear Regression Machine Learning Model in Octave to Detect WiFi Signal Direction Relative to Sensor

## Generates fake training data assuming:

  1. Signal degrades with distance (using exponential decay function to simulate)
  2. Signal degrades with angle of sensor (using cardiod function to simulate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardioid)

## The data is generated by simulating:

1. Turning our sensor. 
We use SS measurements from 3 trailing positions. 
We apply the cardiod function to simulate SS changing based on where we have turned.

2. Choosing random distances between the sensor and AP

## Performance
  1. Scenario: Access Points in Circle Around Sensor **Median error: ~29 degrees**
  2. Scenario: Access Points in One General Direction ** Median error: ~4 degrees** 

## Assumptions
  1. Model requires at least 2 access points

## Further exploration:
  1. Extend model to allow for moving sensor in space (toward/away from AP's). This model currently accounts for changing angle of device, not moving in space.
  2. Extend training to account for 3D space.
  3. Detect different scenarios and dynamically switch models
  4. Add polynomial functions of features (create a function of the turns)
  4. Automated Tuning of the Model. I chose hardcoded values by hand via experimentation.
  
## Usage
Run ap.m with Matlab or Octave
